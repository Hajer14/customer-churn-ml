# Customer Churn Prediction - ML Project

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning.  
It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on customer data to identify which customers are likely to leave.  

The project includes a **full ML pipeline**:
- Data loading
- Preprocessing (encoding, scaling, train/test split)
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Prediction on new data
- Saving model and training columns for future inference

## Dataset
- CSV file: `Customer-Churn.csv`  
- Contains customer information such as:
  - Demographics
  - Subscription details
  - Account activity
